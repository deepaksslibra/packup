## 2024-05-18: Onboarding UI & Interactivity

### Implemented Features

- Built the Onboarding page UI (see app/(onboarding)/onboarding/page.tsx) as described in idea.md:
  - Left panel: App branding, tagline, and value proposition.
  - Right panel: Two clear options for starting a tripâ€”Smart Planning (questionnaire) and Predefined Templates.
- Both options are visually distinct, use icons, and have clear call-to-action buttons.
- Improved interactivity and accessibility:
  - Added cursor-pointer, smooth transitions, and hover effects (shadow, background color) to both Card options for modern, tactile feedback.
  - Ensured both options are keyboard and screen-reader friendly.

### Notes

- This completes the first step of the user journey: a welcoming, modern onboarding screen with clear next actions.
- Next steps: Implement Smart Planning questionnaire flow and Predefined Templates selection as per idea.md.
