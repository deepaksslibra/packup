Ready-made templates (e.g., “Beach Vacation,” “Business Trip,” “Mountain Adventure”) for quick list generation.  

Customizable with trip-specific details.

Trip Editing:

Add, remove, or edit items, set quantities (e.g., 2 t-shirts), and tag items as “Essential”reland “Optional.”  

Save trips locally with AI-assigned default names (editable, e.g., “Paris Trip - June 2025”).

Trip Dashboard:  
View all saved trips, with options to rename or delete.

Interactive checklist with checkboxes and a progress bar (e.g., “75% packed”).  

Downloadable PDF of the checklist for offline use.

Smart Luggage Estimator:  
Estimates total weight of packed items using Gemini API and suggests luggage type (e.g., “Carry-on recommended - ~15 lbs”).

User Journey
The app is designed for ease of use, requiring no account creation. Here’s how a typical user interacts with it:  
Start on Landing/Onboarding Page:  
The user opens the web app and sees a clean, welcoming page with a brief tagline (e.g., “Create a smart packing list for your trip!”).  

Two prominent options: “Smart Planning” (questionnaire) or “Predefined Templates” (e.g., “Beach Vacation”).

Create a Trip:  
Smart Planning: The user answers questions (e.g., “Where are you going?” “When?” “Any activities?”) via a form or chat-like interface. The Gemini API generates a packing list based on inputs and weather data.  

Predefined Templates: The user selects a template, optionally tweaks details (e.g., dates), and the AI generates a list.

Edit the Packing List:  
The user views the AI-generated list, organized by categories (e.g., clothing, toiletries).  

They can modify items, set quantities, tag items as Essential/Optional, and save the trip locally with an AI-suggested name (e.g., “Hawaii Vacation - July 2025”), which they can rename.

Manage Trips:  
The Trip Dashboard shows all saved trips. The user can click a trip to view its checklist, rename it, or delete it.

Pack for the Trip:  
In the Checklist View, the user checks off items as they pack, watching the progress bar update.  

They can download the checklist as a PDF or view the luggage estimator’s recommendation (e.g., “Carry-on - ~12 lbs”).

Complete or Revisit:  
Once packed, the user can export the PDF for reference or revisit the trip later to edit or reuse it.

Core Flows
Below are the primary interaction flows, detailing how users move through the app’s key features.  
Flow 1: Creating a New Trip
Step 1: User lands on the onboarding page and chooses “Smart Planning” or “Predefined Templates.”  

Step 2 (Smart Planning): User completes a questionnaire (e.g., “Destination: Paris,” “Dates: June 1-7, 2025,” “Activities: Sightseeing”). Gemini API fetches weather data (e.g., “20°C, rainy”) and generates a list (e.g., “Umbrella x1, T-shirt x5”).  

Step 2 (Templates): User selects “City Break” template, enters dates, and Gemini API generates a list (e.g., “Passport x1, Charger x1”).  

Step 3: User is redirected to the Trip Editing Page to review and modify the list.  

Step 4: User saves the trip, which appears on the Trip Dashboard with an AI-assigned name (e.g., “Paris Trip - June 2025”).

Flow 2: Editing a Trip
Step 1: User opens the Trip Dashboard and clicks a trip (e.g., “Paris Trip - June 2025”).  

Step 2: In the Trip Editing Page, the list is displayed by categories (e.g., Clothing: “T-shirt x5,” Documents: “Passport x1”).  

Step 3: User adds an item (e.g., “Sunglasses x1”), removes “Umbrella,” changes “T-shirt” to 3, and tags “Passport” as Essential.  

Step 4: User renames the trip (e.g., “Paris Adventure”) and saves changes locally.

Flow 3: Packing and Exporting
Step 1: User selects a trip from the Trip Dashboard and enters the Checklist View.  

Step 2: The checklist shows items with checkboxes (e.g., [ ] T-shirt x3, [ ] Passport x1). User checks off items, and the progress bar updates (e.g., “50% packed”).  

Step 3: User clicks the luggage estimator, which displays “Carry-on recommended - ~10 lbs.”  

Step 4: User clicks “Export PDF” to download the checklist for offline use.

Flow 4: Managing Trips
Step 1: User views the Trip Dashboard, showing all saved trips (e.g., “Paris Adventure,” “Beach Trip - July 2025”).  

Step 2: User renames a trip (e.g., “Beach Trip” to “Hawaii Vacation”) or deletes an old trip.  

Step 3: User selects a trip to view its checklist or edit its packing list.
